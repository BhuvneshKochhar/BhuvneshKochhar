👋 Hi, I’m @BhuvneshKochhar
👀 I’m into everything that makes data dance—analytics, machine learning, and visualization! Tech/AI, finance, and health analytics are my playgrounds.
🌱 Currently diving deep into my Master's in Data Science at The University Of Western Australia, I'm always hungry to learn more!
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that blend data with creativity—whether it’s predictive modeling, visual storytelling, or cracking tough business problems.
📫 You can reach me through my email bhuvneshkochhar@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn linkedin.com/in/bhuvnesh-kochhar-a25699160/. Let’s geek out together!

⚡Fun fact: Whether it’s:
- analyzing the stock market
- exploring the latest in health science research
- diving deep into AI and machine learning

I’ve truly got a passion for it all. If it’s data-driven, I’m in!
