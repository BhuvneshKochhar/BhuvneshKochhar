👋 Hi, I’m @BhuvneshKochhar (but you can call me Nash or Bhuv!)

- 👀 I’m into everything that makes data dance—analytics, machine learning, and visualization! Tech/AI, finance, and health analytics are my playgrounds.
- 🌱 Currently diving deep into my Master's in Data Science at The University Of Western Australia, I'm always hungry to learn more!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that blend data with creativity—whether it’s predictive modeling, visual storytelling, or cracking tough business problems.
- 📫 You can reach me through my email bhuvneshkochhar@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn www.linkedin.com/in/bhuvnesh-kochhar-a25699160. Let’s geek out together!
- ⚡ Fun fact: Data is boring to most, but I love it—probably because I’ve lived in Perth my whole life, and I’ve learned to find excitement in the details!
